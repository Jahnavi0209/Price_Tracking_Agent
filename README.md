# Price_Tracking_Agent
This project is an automated price tracker that fetches product prices from Amazon and Flipkart, compares them, and sends an email alert when the price drops below a set threshold. It runs on a modular multi-agent system with scraping, comparison, notification, and scheduling agents for seamless automation.
